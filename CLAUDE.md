# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project

美团编程游戏化练习激励工具 (Meituan Coding Gamified Exercise Motivation Tool).

This is a greenfield project — no build, lint, or test infrastructure exists yet. When setting up the project, choose conventions appropriate to the tech stack selected.

## Superpowers Skills

This repo uses the [superpowers](https://github.com/obra/superpowers) skills framework. All skill definitions are symlinked in `.claude/skills/`. When working on features, always invoke the relevant skill (brainstorming, test-driven-development, systematic-debugging, etc.) before writing code.

## 0. Response Language

**Always respond in Simplified Chinese.**

- All explanations, plans, clarifying questions, summaries, and final answers must be written in Simplified Chinese.
- Keep code, commands, file paths, API names, error messages, and quoted source text in their original language when necessary.
- If the user explicitly requests another language, follow the user's request for that response only.

## 1. Think Before Coding

**Don't assume. Don't hide confusion. Surface tradeoffs.**

Before implementing:

- State your assumptions explicitly. If uncertain, ask.
- If multiple interpretations exist, present them - don't pick silently.
- If a simpler approach exists, say so. Push back when warranted.
- If something is unclear, stop. Name what's confusing. Ask.

## 2. Simplicity First

**Minimum code that solves the problem. Nothing speculative.**

- No features beyond what was asked.
- No abstractions for single-use code.
- No "flexibility" or "configurability" that wasn't requested.
- No error handling for impossible scenarios.
- If you write 200 lines and it could be 50, rewrite it.

Ask yourself: "Would a senior engineer say this is overcomplicated?" If yes, simplify.

## 3. Surgical Changes

**Touch only what you must. Clean up only your own mess.**

When editing existing code:

- Don't "improve" adjacent code, comments, or formatting.
- Don't refactor things that aren't broken.
- Match existing style, even if you'd do it differently.
- If you notice unrelated dead code, mention it - don't delete it.

When your changes create orphans:

- Remove imports/variables/functions that YOUR changes made unused.
- Don't remove pre-existing dead code unless asked.

The test: Every changed line should trace directly to the user's request.

## 4. Goal-Driven Execution

**Define success criteria. Loop until verified.**

Transform tasks into verifiable goals:

- "Add validation" → "Write tests for invalid inputs, then make them pass"
- "Fix the bug" → "Write a test that reproduces it, then make it pass"
- "Refactor X" → "Ensure tests pass before and after"

For multi-step tasks, state a brief plan:

```
1. [Step] → verify: [check]
2. [Step] → verify: [check]
3. [Step] → verify: [check]
```

Strong success criteria let you loop independently. Weak criteria ("make it work") require constant clarification.
